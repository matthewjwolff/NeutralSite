        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Neutral Snap is a 5-piece rock band hailing from New Orleans, Louisiana. The group consists of original members J.P Brown (Guitar), Walker Legrand (Guitar), and Joshua Latham (vocals) as well as Dominick Conforte (bass) and George Neyrey V (Drums).
Their performance at the iconic Fred’s in Tigerland during the LSU-Mississippi State weekend of 2015 was hallmarked by Shaquille O’Neal joining the group on stage to perform a song with them. 
The group burst onto the college music scene in the spring of 2017 with their “Make Live Music Great Again” tour. Upon returning home to Baton Rouge, the band switched their focus to writing their upcoming EP, despite being known as mostly a cover band prior to that point. 
The group returned to the road in the summer of that year as they embarked on their “Stay Tuned” tour to publicize their upcoming EP. To close out a wildly successful summer tour, the boys returned home to perform to a sold out crowd at the iconic House of Blues in New Orleans.
On July 24, 2017, Neutral Snap released their debut single, Out of Formality 
on Spotify and other streaming services, which was met with reasonable success. That fall, they would go on to be noticed by and open for such national acts as Afroman, Metro Station, We The Kings, and indie pop duo Cherub. 
Their debut EP “Stay Tuned” EP has been released on all mainstream streaming services.</p>
